# Spectra

Spectra is a comprehensive stress-testing framework for perceptual hashing algortihms, capable of simulating hardware-optimized versions of both hash-specific and black-box attacks.

## Motivation
There is a growing body of research that perceptual hash algorithms are particularly vulnerable to gradient-based adversarial attacks. The motivation behind Spectra is to enable easier and more efficient benchmarking of image hashing pipelines for the purpose of evaluating robustness to hostile actors. In other words, it's like Cinebench for your content flagging system. 

The objective of this project is as follows:
1) Develop a more robust framework to enable developers to more rigorously test their image hashing pipelines against adversarial-style attacks.
2) Create a widely accepted standard for evaluating the overall robustness of image recognition systems.
