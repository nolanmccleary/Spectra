1. You must explicitly ask for permission to implement something that would change the dimensionality of one or more of the tensors already present in this codebase. 

2. If a rework is required and it implements a new tensor pipeline with different geometry or memory access characteristics than what is already present, you must explictly ask for permission to implement it. 

3. If you wish to use any sort of clamping on any existing tensor anywhere in the codebase, you must explicitly ask for permission to do so.
